<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a hearty, oven-baked Italian dish layered with flat pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. 
    The pasta sheets are typically layered with a robust Bolognese sauce made from ground beef, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and Italian herbs, simmered until 
    thick and flavorful. Each layer is generously topped with a creamy béchamel sauce and sprinkled with a blend of cheeses, often including mozzarella and Parmesan, which me

    pasta, rich sauce, and gooey cheese.
