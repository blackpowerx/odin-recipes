<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mac and cheese is a classic comfort food consisting of tender elbow macaroni pasta coated in a creamy, cheesy sauce. The sauce is typically made from a combination of melted cheeses, such as cheddar, mozzarella, or Gruyère, blended with a béchamel or roux-based sauce to create a smooth, rich texture. It may be seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices like paprika or mustard powder for added flavor. The dish is often baked until the top is golden and crispy, resulting in a satisfying contrast between the creamy interior and the crunchy topping. Mac and cheese can be enjoyed as a main course or a side dish.
