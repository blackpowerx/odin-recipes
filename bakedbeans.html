<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Baked beans are a comforting, slow-cooked dish typically made with small navy beans simmered in a sweet and savory sauce. The beans are often stewed in a mixture of molasses or brown sugar, tomato sauce, and spices like mustard, onion, and sometimes a hint of smoky bacon or ham for added depth of flavor. The dish is baked until the beans are tender and the sauce thickens, creating a rich, flavorful blend thatâ€™s both hearty and satisfying. Baked beans are a classic side dish, often served with barbecue, grilled meats, or as part of a traditional breakfast.
